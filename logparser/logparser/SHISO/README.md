# SHISO

SHISO is a method for mining log formats and retrieving log types and parameters in an online manner. By creating a structured tree using the nodes generated from log messages, SHISO refines log format continuously in realtime. We implemented SHISO using Python with a standard interface for benchmarking purpose.

### Running

The code has been tested in the following enviornment:
+ python 3.7.6
+ regex 2022.3.2
+ pandas 1.0.1
+ numpy 1.18.1
+ scipy 1.4.1
+ nltk 3.4.5

Run the following script to start the demo:

```
python demo.py
```

Run the following script to execute the benchmark:

```
