# MoLFI

MoLFI (Multi-objective Log message Format Identification) is a tool implementing a search-based approach to solve the problem of log message format identification. MoLFI uses an evolutionary approach based on NSGA-II to solve this problem.

MoLFI applies the following steps:

1. Pre-processing the log file (detect trivial variable parts using domain knowledge).
2. Run NSGA-II algorithm.
3. Post-processing: apply corrections to the resulting solutions.
