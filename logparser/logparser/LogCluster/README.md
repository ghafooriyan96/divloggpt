# LogCluster

LogCluster is a Perl-based tool for log file clustering and mining line patterns from log files. The development of LogCluster was inspired by [SLCT](http://ristov.github.io/slct/), but LogCluster includes a number of novel features and data processing options. 

To provide a common interface for log parsing, we write a Python wrapper around the original [LogCluster source code in Perl](https://github.com/ristov/logcluster). This also eases our benchmarking experiments. The implementation has been tested on both Linux and Windows systems. Especially, [Strawberry Perl](http://strawberryperl.com/) has been installed to run the Perl program on Windows.
