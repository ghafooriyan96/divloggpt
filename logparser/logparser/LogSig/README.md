# LogSig

LogSig is a message signature based algorithm to generate system events from textual log messages. By searching the most representative message signatures, LogSig categorizes log messages into a set of event templates. LogSig can handle various types of log data, and is able to incorporate human's domain knowledge to achieve a high performance. We implemented LogSig using Python with a standard interface for benchmarking purpose.
